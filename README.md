[List of commands](https://github.com/Goksi/Raveolution/wiki/Commands)
## Configuration
For managing yaml configuration im using [YamlConfiguration](https://github.com/bspfsystems/YamlConfiguration) by bspfsystems which is vased of SpigotMC's configuration sub-project <br />

One downside that I personally dont like (prob will change that in future) is that you have to restart bot everytime you change something in config, also when using commands like `/setupprivate` you will have to manually insert info that bot give you into config.yml. <br />

## Info
### Setup
Setup is actually easy as **. Just download Raveolution.jar from releases, upload it to your server or anything you want to host bot on and type `java -jar Raveolution.jar`. You can run it in backgroun using `screen` or whatever. File is compiled with Java 8.
